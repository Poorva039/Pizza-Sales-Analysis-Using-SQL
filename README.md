In this project, I worked on creating and analyzing a database for pizza sales. I wrote different types of SQL queries that are commonly used in real-world business scenarios, such as:

1) **Retrieving Data:** Queries to select and filter data from tables to find specific information, like all pizza orders or the details of popular pizzas.
2) **Aggregating Data:** Used functions like SUM, COUNT, and AVG to calculate total revenue, the number of orders, and average sales per day.
3) **Finding Trends:** Grouped data by time, size, or category to see patterns, like which pizzas sell the most or when orders peak during the day.
4) **Ranking and Sorting:** Used queries to rank pizza types by revenue or popularity and list the top-performing ones.
5) **Joins:** Combined data from multiple tables using joins to answer questions like which pizza categories contribute the most to revenue.
6) **Advanced Calculations:** Applied window functions to calculate cumulative revenue and rank items within each category.
7) **Percentage Calculations:** Found out the percentage contribution of each pizza type to the total sales.

This project helped me practice writing queries that answer important business questions and provide useful insights from data.
